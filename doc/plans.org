* Priority
** TODO Clean up this document and be more descriptive
** TODO Change moving clients to unreachable tags to use respective tags
The point of this is so if a tag is on tag 3, for example, when it is
moved from an unreachable tag, it should stay on tag 3.

** TODO Add a binding to switch tags for both screens at once
It turns out individual tags isn't nearly as useful and is more annoying than anything
Ideally a better solution would be to add a keybind to place a window on multiple
(or all) tags for a given screen, as oppose to trying to manage tags individually,
for every single screen.

* Backburner
** TODO See if it is possible to place plasmashell windows properly for multi-monitor
This may be possible by extracting primitive information like window dimensions
and checking it against similar windows on this current screen.

This could be reapplied when the window setup changes
