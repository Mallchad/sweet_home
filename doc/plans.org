* Priority
** TODO Clean up this document and be more descriptive
** TODO Change moving clients to unreachable tags to use respective tags
The point of this is so if a tag is on tag 3, for example, when it is
moved from an unreachable tag, it should stay on tag 3.


* Backburner
** TODO See if it is possible to place plasmashell windows properly for multi-monitor
This may be possible by extracting primitive information like window dimensions
and checking it against similar windows on this current screen.

This could be reapplied when the window setup changes
